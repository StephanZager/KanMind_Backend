# KanMind Backend API

This is a backend API service for a Kanban board application, built with Python, Django, and the Django REST Framework. The API allows for the management of boards, tasks, and comments with a role-based permission system where users can share and collaborate on boards.

## 🔧 Features

-   **User Authentication:** Registration and token-based login.
-   **Board Management:** Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for boards.
-   **Collaboration:** Users can invite other registered users to their boards as members.
-   **Task Management:** Full management of tasks within boards.
-   **Comment System:** Add and delete comments on tasks.
-   **Permission System:** Clear, role-based rules (Owner, Board Member, Task Creator).

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

-   **Python 3.13.1**
-   **Django 5.2**
-   **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
-   **SQLite** (for development)
-   **CORS Support** (via `django-cors-headers`)

## 📌 Notes

-   Users can access boards they own or have been added to as a member. This allows for collaboration.
-   CORS is configured to allow frontend applications to communicate with the backend.
-   For a production environment, the SQLite database should be replaced with a more robust solution like PostgreSQL.
